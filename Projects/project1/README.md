CATcher


This is a project written by Atima Ng. This simulation is my submission for "Project 1: Simulation" for the CART253 course at Concordia University. This project was supported by the help of professor Pippin Barr and the teacher assistant Dana Ryashy.

CATcher is a simulation where cats are falling from the sky and it is your duty as a lawful citizen to save all the cats and bring them to safety. The user must click the first two title/instruction screen until the simulation begins. Afterwards, the user controls the magic pillow with the mouse movement and must align the pillow with the cats to catch the falling cats. The user is faced with the "win" screen if they successfully catch all five cats and are faced with the "loser" screen if they do not.

Do you dare to catch all the cats?
