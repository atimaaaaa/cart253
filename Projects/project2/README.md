Get That Bread!

Art and code by Atima Ng.

INSTRUCTIONS
Use the arrow keys to guide Antonio the ant towards the foods: cherries and bread. Be careful to avoid those pesky rocks along the way as those damage the internal organ system of Ants. Gather as much food for the princess before time runs out!


ARTIST STATEMENT
This simulation explores the digital pixel-based games of the early 2000's. Games were centered around a grid and a simple grid-by-grid movement of the user. By controlling the user with the arrow keys, the user is able to control Antonio the ant and experience the life as a pixel-based ant for the first time in their lives. The goal of this simulation is to invite the user to observe and appreciate how grid-based games can be created. By combining the art of storytelling with a simulation game, the user embarks on quest with a mission instead of mindlessly playing a game online. Visually, the colours are bright, colourful and inviting, making it an experience enjoyable to play and look at visually. The code carefully guides the user towards their goal with the implementation of a wrap around the grid blanket, the grid-by-grid movement, the scoreboard and a timer. Overall, "Get that Bread" is a simulation for all to escape from their daily routine to live their life as an ant temporarily. 

Enjoy and go get that bread!
